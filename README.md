## 📋 About the Project

**SillyBlog** is a modern blog platform built with microservices architecture. The project demonstrates distributed development practices, inter-service communication, event-driven messaging with RabbitMQ, and horizontal scalability.

### 🎯 Current Status: **Production Ready MVP**
- ✅ Complete authentication system with JWT
- ✅ Full post management (CRUD operations)  
- ✅ Modern responsive UI with real-time updates
- ✅ Microservices communication with RabbitMQ
- ✅ Docker containerization and orchestration

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Microservices

- **🎨 Client** - Next.js frontend with Ant Design and Tailwind CSS
- **🚪 API Gateway** - Request routing and proxying with JWT middleware
- **🔐 Auth Service** - Authentication, authorization and user management
- **📝 Post Service** - Post CRUD operations and content management
- **🐰 RabbitMQ** - Event-driven messaging between services

### Database

- **PostgreSQL 15** - Two separate instances:
  - `auth-db` (port 5432) - User authentication and profile data
  - `post-db` (port 5433) - Posts and content data

## 🚀 Technologies

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **Ant Design 5** - UI component system
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **TypeScript** - Static typing

### Backend
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js** - Web framework
- **Prisma** - Database ORM
- **JWT** - Token-based authentication

### Infrastructure
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Containerization and orchestration
- **PostgreSQL 15** - Relational database
- **RabbitMQ** - Message broker for event-driven communication

## 📦 Prerequisites

- **Docker** >= 20.0
- **Docker Compose** >= 2.0
- **Node.js** >= 18.0 
- **npm**

## 🛠️ Installation and Execution

### Complete Execution with Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sillyveira/sillyblog.git
cd sillyblog

# Run all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Service Ports

- **Client (Frontend)**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **API Gateway**: `http://localhost:8080` 
- **Auth Service**: `http://localhost:3000` (internal)
- **Post Service**: `http://localhost:3001` (internal)
- **RabbitMQ Management**: `http://localhost:15672` (guest/guest)
- **Auth Database**: `localhost:5432`
- **Post Database**: `localhost:5433`
